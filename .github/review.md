# Step 6 Review Record

## Scope

Review the current implementation against `reuirement.md`, `architecture.md`, and `impl-plan.md`.

## Required Review Dimensions

- Correctness of create, list, update, conflict, delete, share, revoke, and public-read behavior
- Owner authorization and public access boundaries
- Error status codes and safe error messages
- Test coverage for happy paths, invalid input, conflicts, deletion, and sharing
- Code clarity, duplication, and maintainability
- Dependency and supply-chain risk
- Prototype limitations versus production-readiness claims

## Current Known Risks

The documented implementation is a prototype. It uses in-memory storage, a demo-user header instead of real authentication, and does not yet provide persistence, attachments, OpenAPI, frontend tests, or production operational controls. These are not silently waived by this review; they remain launch-gate work in `impl-plan.md`.

## Findings

- **High:** The `x-user-id` request header is caller-controlled, so it is not an authentication boundary. PLAN-030 through PLAN-034 must replace it with validated sessions, CSRF protection, and rate limiting before production use.
- **High:** Notes and share links are stored only in process memory and are lost on restart. PLAN-020 through PLAN-025 must provide durable persistence, migrations, backups, and recovery evidence.
- **High:** The 30 MB check currently measures title and text only; attachments are not implemented. PLAN-060 through PLAN-066 must add allowlist, magic-byte, aggregate-size, private-storage, signed-download, and cleanup coverage.
- **Medium:** There is no frontend test or Playwright acceptance suite. PLAN-074 and PLAN-081 must cover accessibility, public sharing, conflict handling, deletion, and revoked-link behavior.
