# ShareNotes

ShareNotes is a note management and sharing application. The current repository contains a working vertical slice for creating, editing, deleting, and sharing notes through public read-only links.

The project is being built from the requirements and architecture documents in this repository. The current implementation is a development prototype and is not production-ready yet.

## Features Currently Implemented

- Create a note with a title and text content.
- List notes for the development user.
- Open and edit an existing note.
- Optimistic version checks for updates.
- Return `409 Conflict` when an older note version is submitted.
- Soft-delete notes.
- Generate an opaque public share token.
- Copy a share link to the clipboard.
- Show an animated copied-link preview in the frontend.
- View a shared note without editing controls.
- Invalidate a shared link when its note is deleted.
- Enforce a 30 MB limit for the current note title and content payload.
- Responsive frontend layout for desktop and mobile widths.

```

## Prerequisites

- Node.js compatible with the installed project dependencies.
- npm.
- PowerShell on Windows, or Bash for the shell launcher.

No database or Docker installation is required for the current prototype because the backend uses in-memory storage.

## Install Dependencies

From the repository root:

```powershell
Push-Location backend
npm install
Pop-Location

Push-Location frontend
npm install
Pop-Location
```

On Bash:

```bash
(cd backend && npm install)
(cd frontend && npm install)
```

## Start the Application

### Windows PowerShell

From the repository root:

```powershell
.\start-sharenotes.ps1
```

The script opens the backend and frontend using their local project binaries.

### Bash

From the repository root:

```bash
bash ./start-sharenotes.sh
```

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop both services.

### Start Services Manually

Backend:

```powershell
Push-Location backend
.\node_modules\.bin\nest.cmd start --watch --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3000
```

Frontend, in a second terminal:

```powershell
Push-Location frontend
.\node_modules\.bin\vite.cmd --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5173
```

## Local URLs

- Frontend: http://localhost:5173/
- API notes endpoint: http://localhost:3000/api/v1/notes
- API base path: http://localhost:3000/api/v1

The frontend currently uses the development identity `demo-user` through the `x-user-id` request header.

## Current API Surface

All API routes use the `/api/v1` prefix.

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST` | `/notes` | Create a note |
| `GET` | `/notes` | List active notes for the current development user |
| `GET` | `/notes/:noteId` | Retrieve an owned note |
| `PATCH` | `/notes/:noteId` | Update an owned note using its current `version` |
| `DELETE` | `/notes/:noteId` | Soft-delete an owned note |
| `POST` | `/notes/:noteId/share` | Create or reuse an active share link |
| `DELETE` | `/notes/:noteId/share/:token` | Revoke a share link |
| `GET` | `/shared/:token` | Read a shared note without authentication |

Example create request:

```powershell
$body = @{ title = 'First note'; content = 'A note from ShareNotes.' } | ConvertTo-Json
Invoke-RestMethod `
  -Method Post `
  -Uri http://localhost:3000/api/v1/notes `
  -Headers @{ 'x-user-id' = 'demo-user' } `
  -ContentType 'application/json' `
  -Body $body
```

Example update request:

```powershell
$body = @{
  title = 'Updated note'
  content = 'Updated content.'
  version = 1
} | ConvertTo-Json

Invoke-RestMethod `
  -Method Patch `
  -Uri http://localhost:3000/api/v1/notes/<note-id> `
  -Headers @{ 'x-user-id' = 'demo-user' } `
  -ContentType 'application/json' `
  -Body $body
```

## Validation Commands

Backend:

```powershell
Push-Location backend
npm run build
npm test
npm run lint
```

Frontend:

```powershell
Push-Location frontend
npm run build
npm run lint
```

The frontend lint currently reports a non-blocking React warning related to state updates inside an effect. It does not fail the lint command.

## Persistence Status

The current backend does **not** use PostgreSQL or another persistent database.

Notes and share links are stored in JavaScript `Map` instances inside the running NestJS process. As a result:

- Data exists only while the backend process is running.
- Restarting the backend clears notes and share links.
- Starting the application again does not restore previous notes.
- The launcher scripts do not start PostgreSQL, MinIO, or Redis.

The next persistence phase is planned to add PostgreSQL, migrations, object storage, Redis, and a database-backed notes service. See [impl-plan.md](impl-plan.md) for the dependency-ordered implementation plan.

## Current Limitations

### Authentication and Authorization

- There is no real registration, login, identity provider, session, refresh-token, or CSRF implementation.
- The development identity is supplied through `x-user-id: demo-user`.
- A caller who can choose that header can impersonate the demo user.
- Production authentication and authorization must be implemented before deployment.

### Storage and Attachments

- Notes are stored in memory rather than PostgreSQL.
- Attachments are not implemented yet.
- The 30 MB check currently covers the serialized title and text content only.
- MinIO or cloud object storage is not configured.
- Signed upload and download URLs are not implemented.
- Attachment cleanup jobs, retries, and retention jobs are not implemented.

### Rich Text and Security

- The editor is currently a text area, not a Tiptap or Lexical rich-text editor.
- Backend and frontend rich-text sanitization is not implemented.
- There is no configured content security policy, rate limiting, audit log, or security scanning pipeline.
- The public share token is generated securely for the prototype, but token hashes are not persisted because there is no database yet.

### Operations

- There is no Docker Compose environment yet.
- There are no database migrations, backups, restore procedures, or production deployment configuration.
- The launcher scripts start application processes only.
- Observability, distributed tracing, dashboards, and alerting are not configured.
- The frontend API URL is currently hard-coded to `http://localhost:3000/api/v1`.

### Product Scope

- Real-time collaborative editing is out of scope for v1.
- Note attachments, multiple users, search, note folders, and link expiration are not currently available.
- Public shared links are read-only, but full production access controls remain to be implemented.

## Recommended Next Steps

1. Add Docker Compose for PostgreSQL, MinIO, and Redis.
2. Add environment-based configuration and database migrations.
3. Replace the in-memory maps with PostgreSQL repositories.
4. Implement real authentication, sessions, CSRF protection, and rate limits.
5. Integrate Tiptap or Lexical with backend and frontend sanitization.
6. Add attachment validation, private object storage, signed URLs, and cleanup jobs.
7. Add OpenAPI documentation and integration tests for persistence and security.
8. Add CI/CD, observability, backups, deployment, and rollback runbooks.
