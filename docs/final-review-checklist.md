- [x] Reviewed technology choices and module responsibilities.
- [x] Reviewed create, edit, share, and delete data flows.
- [x] Reviewed owner authorization and public read-only access boundaries.
- [x] Reviewed the 30 MB aggregate note and attachment-size enforcement.
- [x] Reviewed share-token generation, storage, and deletion behavior.
- [x] Reviewed concurrency and simultaneous-edit behavior.
- [x] Reviewed cache headers, stale content, and deletion invalidation.
- [x] Reviewed attachment upload, download, and cleanup failure paths.
- [x] Reviewed rich-text XSS protection and attachment file validation.
- [x] Reviewed sessions, CSRF protection, rate limits, and abuse controls.
- [x] Reviewed API errors, pagination, conditional requests, and response contracts.
- [x] Reviewed database indexes, transactions, migrations, and rollback strategy.
- [x] Reviewed observability, audit logging, alerting, and health checks.
- [x] Reviewed testability, API contracts, integration tests, and end-to-end coverage.
- [x] Documented findings and design decisions in [design-review.md](design-review.md).
- [x] Updated [architecture.md](architecture.md) with the agreed review decisions.

## Architecture Readiness Checks

### Security

- [x] Owner-only mutation authorization is required.
- [x] Share tokens are opaque and read-only.
- [x] Rich-text sanitization and an allowed-content model are specified.
- [x] Attachment allowlist and magic-byte verification are specified.
- [x] Session, CSRF, HTTPS, and rate-limit controls are specified.
- [ ] Authentication provider and exact credential policy are selected.

### Data and Consistency

- [x] Optimistic locking uses a note version and `409 Conflict`.
- [x] Note deletion behavior and public `404` behavior are specified.
- [x] Share-link revocation is specified.
- [x] Attachment cleanup retries, dead-letter handling, and SLA are specified.
- [x] Database transaction boundaries are specified.
- [ ] Exact database migrations and recovery procedures are implemented and tested.

### API and UX Contracts

- [x] Core note and sharing endpoints are listed.
- [x] Error response structure and trace identifiers are specified.
- [x] Note-list pagination and sorting are specified.
- [x] Read-only shared-note behavior is specified.
- [ ] OpenAPI schemas and generated client contracts are created.

### Operations and Delivery

- [x] Deployment and migration compatibility strategy is specified.
- [x] Observability and alert categories are specified.
- [x] Backup, restore, and incident runbooks are identified as deliverables.
- [x] Real-time collaboration is explicitly out of scope for v1.
- [ ] CI/CD, staging, load testing, and rollback exercises are configured.

### Test Plan

- [x] Unit, integration, contract, security, and end-to-end test categories are identified.
- [x] Required critical flows include create, edit conflict, share, revoke, delete, and public `404` behavior.
- [x] The 30 MB boundary and disallowed file types are identified as test cases.
- [ ] Automated tests exist and pass in CI.

## Decision

**Architecture review result:** Conditionally approved for implementation planning.

The architecture is ready to be decomposed into detailed API schemas, database migrations, security controls, test cases, and operational runbooks. Production implementation should wait until the unchecked detailed-design and delivery items are assigned and reviewed.
